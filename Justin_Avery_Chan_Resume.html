                </header>
                <p>Over four years at Amplitude, grew from intern to Product Engineer II while helping shape the company's core analytics experience. Designed and built systems that make complex data analysis intuitive and reliable, bridging user intent with technical computation across products like Data Tables, Metrics, and AI-powered chart interfaces. Worked across the full stack — primarily in React and TypeScript, with contributions to GraphQL and back-end configuration — to deliver resilient, human-centered tools. Partnered closely with product managers, designers, and customers to translate analytical precision into simple, trustworthy workflows, from early prototypes to large-scale rollouts.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built and maintained <strong>core analytics features</strong> such as Data Tables, Metrics, and Chart Controls, enabling users to define analytical queries through intuitive UI controls reused across multiple product areas.</li>
                    <li>Led feature development for <strong>pre-built analytics experiences ("Hubs")</strong>, including the Marketing, Product, and Ad Performance Hubs, translating business-specific needs into guided analytical flows.</li>
                    <li>Independently developed <strong>Out-of-the-Box Metrics</strong> to give users default insights without setup, improving onboarding and product accessibility.</li>
                    <li>Co-created <strong>Chart Chat</strong>, an AI-powered interface that lets users modify charts through natural language, later expanded into the company's <strong>Global Chat</strong> initiative integrating LLMs and MCP servers.</li>
                    <li>Implemented and maintained <strong>system improvements</strong> such as Dark Mode (via new GraphQL endpoints), library upgrades (Ag Grid migration), and search/filter enhancements to streamline everyday workflows.</li>
                    <li>Managed <strong>feature rollouts</strong> with feature flags, supported reliability as an <strong>on-call engineer</strong> (debugging Cypress tests, managing deploys, coordinating rollbacks).</li>
                    <li>Collaborated directly with product and design to refine complex UX — adding warnings, bulk actions, and multi-select to reduce friction and increase clarity in analytical tools.</li>
                    <li>Conducted <strong>customer calls and bug safaris</strong> to uncover usability issues and propose design or technical solutions aligned with real-world needs.</li>
                    <li>Mentored and onboarded engineers; contributed to cross-org efforts such as pricing and packaging updates.</li>
                    <li>Grew from front-end specialist to full-stack contributor, integrating <strong>LLM, GraphQL, and back-end configuration work</strong> into the analytics ecosystem while maintaining a strong user-experience orientation.</li>
